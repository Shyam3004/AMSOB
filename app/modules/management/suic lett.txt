Body Dysmorphic Disorder

It sucks my confidence out.
Like a vampire to blood.
I can't with the society.
The standard and all.
I hate myself for living with that.
It is so unfair.

Living with all these flaws
While others do not
Things go easy with them
Because they are god-looking alike
Everyone will be your friend
I like to be that
Unfortunately I can't
Cause I'm nowhere like that.

20-minute suicidal thoughts every night
is rough
Everytime I see myself in the mirror
I want to break it
shatter it
punch it
because my inner saboteur always let me show
my flaws and put it up against me
saying, you are never good enough.
Thus, that makes me afraid
of what the world would
say about me.

I know I shouldn't live with society's expectation.
But if you meet it
Everyone would listen
Eveything you say would have an advantage
because what? You look gorgeous.
For sure, it feels good to.
And that is the reality.

I don't know how to win this fight
Fuck, I know, but I can't.
Writing is my only weapon.
I have 100 problems
and this alone is 99 of them.

I feel like I'm facing this all alone.
No one is there to help me.
I have never been this weak.
I know I could overcome this
But I'm tired.

Suicide is never an option,
but why not.
It ends all things.
Easy as that.
Then everyone would love me
Symphatize for me
Be sad for me.
How great is that.
For once in my life,
I would feel that.

I'm going out of this room,
smiling to the people
hiding something heavy
That I can't carry
anymore.

At least they would think I'm fine
That I ain't got no problems at all
They wouldnt mind.

I love my friends, my family.
But I was born alone.
It is my responsibility.

Shit I'm running out of words.
I want to sleep.
